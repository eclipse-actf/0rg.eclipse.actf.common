/**
 * an interface to aid processing engines in 
 * locating or describing components of a model during a process.
 * Implementations perform two primary functions:
 * 
 * <p><ul>
 * <li>locate - constructs an XPath expression to locate an element within a model
 * <li>describe - attempts to distinguish a particular element from others by providing its id, name, textual content, etc.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Implementations are model-specific and should be defined within model configuration files. They should also 
 * not implement this interface directly, but extend <code>AbstractNodeLocator</code>.
